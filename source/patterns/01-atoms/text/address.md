title: Default address
state: complete

This is a default address tag.

To represent an arbitrary address, one that is not related to the contact information, use a `<p>` element rather than the `<address>` element. This element should not contain more information than the contact information, like a publication date (which belongs in a `<time>` element). Typically an `<address>` element can be placed inside the `<footer>` element of the current section, if any.
